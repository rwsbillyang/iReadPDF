# iReadPDF
An Android PDFViewer app which can restore reading state of last time based on Jetpack compose. 
It is usually impossible to read a book continuously due to the interference of various affairs or activities. So when I read PDF books, I hope to restore the last reading state, including page position, scroll position,  zoom level, portrait or landscape, just for using the fragmented time as fully as possible.
So iReadPDF app is born.
